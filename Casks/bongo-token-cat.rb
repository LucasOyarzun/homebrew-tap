# Homebrew cask for BongoTokenCat.
#
# This file is the source of truth; `scripts/release.sh` stamps the version and
# checksum into a copy and pushes that to the tap repo (LucasOyarzun/homebrew-tap).
# It lives here rather than only in the tap so the `zap` paths can be updated in
# the same commit as the code that starts writing them.
#
# In this copy the version and sha256 are placeholders; the copy in the tap has
# the real ones stamped in.

  # Everything the app writes. The Claude Code hook is deliberately absent: it
  # lives in the user's own ~/.claude/settings.json alongside their other hooks,
  # and a cask cannot safely edit that JSON. Hence the caveat below.

  caveats <<~CAVEATS
    Open the menu bar icon and press "Install hooks" to let BongoTokenCat see
    your agents. That registers a hook in ~/.claude/settings.json, merging with
    any hooks you already have and writing a backup first.

    Before uninstalling, press "Remove hooks" in the same menu. Homebrew will not
    touch ~/.claude/settings.json, so an entry left behind would point at a hook
    script that no longer exists.
  CAVEATS
